#### Goals:
* Garage iOT device knowledge of the state of your garage door and push notification if you leave your garage open
* iOS app with integration with Foscam camera to see video inside your garage

##### Fritzing wiring diagram & screenshots of the iOS experience in /documents; example pushover json in /pushover; firmware in /photon

* Others:  An Enclosure for Logic board, a USB power supply, Adhesive tape, 22 AWG wire for Garage connection, enclosure for ultrasonic motion sensor, alarm/doorbell wire between the device and the sensor/relay
